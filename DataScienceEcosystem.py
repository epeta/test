# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized

# **Objectives**
# 
# -list popular languages for data scientist
# 
# -list commonly used libraries by data scientist
# 
# -Show example of arithmetic expressions

# Some of the popular launguages that Data scientists use are:
# 1. Phyton
# 2. R
# 3. C++

# Some of the commonly used libraryies used by data scientists include
# 1. Numpy
# 2. Pandas
# 3. Scipy
